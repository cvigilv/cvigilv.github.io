I'm a chilean biochemist turned *computational biologist* currently pursuing my PhD at the Université de Lille, focusing on /reconstructing the evolutionary tree of life through the lens of cellular metabolism leveraging novel computational paradigms for biological system representation./

My current *research interest* center around:

- Understanding how *evolution* shapes biological systems to *guide discovery through
  open-endedness*
- Computational & mathematical *representations of biological systems*
- *Network* biology and its relationship to *biological complexity*


I highly advocate for *open science and open source software* as means for progress based in collaboration and education, where I invest some of my free time in scientific software development and personal knowledge systems.
