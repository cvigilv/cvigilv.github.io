I'm a chilean biochemist turned *computational biologist* currently pursuing my PhD at the Universit√© de Lille, focusing on /reconstructing the evolutionary tree of life through the lens of cellular metabolism leveraging novel computational paradigms for biological system representation./

My current *research interest* center around:

- Understanding how *evolution* shapes biological systems to *guide discovery through open-endedness*
- Computational & mathematical *representations of biological systems*
- *Network* biology and its relationship to *biological complexity*

Additionally, I'm interested on *personal knowledge management (PKMs) and personal development environments (PDEs)*, where I invest some of my free time *developing open-source software and tooling* to tackle problems related to my note taking system and Neovim.

My complete CV can be found [[file:media/cv_en_long.pdf][here]].
