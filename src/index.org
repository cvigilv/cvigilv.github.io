I'm a chilean /biochemist/-turned-/computational biologist/ currently pursuing my PhD at the Université de Lille, focusing on reconstructing a evolutionary Tree-of-Life using unconventional computational paradigms for biological system representation.

My current research interest center around:

- Computational & mathematical representations of biological systems
- Biological networks and its relationship to biological complexity
- Personal knowledge management (PKMs) and personal development environments (PDEs) for scientific
  (research) software development
