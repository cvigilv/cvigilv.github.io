#+TITLE: Projects

I believe that the best way to learn is by doing, and that the best way to do is by sharing.
With that in mind, here are some of the projects I'm currently working on:

Science ([[https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RkivvsgAAAAJ&hl=en][my publications]]):
- [[https://github.com/schuellerlab/ijms2022_simspread][/De novo/ prediction of drug targets and candidates by chemical similarity-guided network-based inference]]
- [[https://github.com/cvigilv/ResidueFisher][ResidueFisher]], a bioinformatics
  protocol that aims at mining information at the sequence and structure level
  of the protein chain to detect possible evolutionarily conserved residues

Neovim:
- [[https://github.com/cvigilv/diferente.nvim][diferente.nvim]], a plugin for enhancing the UX of Git commits in Neovim, inspired in commitia.vim.
- [[https://github.com/cvigilv/esqueleto.nvim][esqueleto.nvim]], a plugin for managing template files in Neovim.
- [[https://github.com/cvigilv/denote.nvim][denote.nvim]], a plugin for simple notes for Neovim with an efficient file-naming scheme.

Julia language:
- [[https://github.com/schuellerlab/SimSpread.jl][SimSpread.jl]], a software package implements the SimSpread algorithm for link prediction in graphs.
- [[https://github.com/MichielStock/HyperdimensionalComputing.jl][HyperdimensionalComputing.jl]], a software package for hyperdimensional computing (HDC) in Julia.
- [[https://github.com/cvigilv/KEGGAPI.jl][KEGGAPI.jl]], a library for working with the KEGG API.
- [[https://github.com/cvigilv/HyperGen.jl][HyperGen.jl]], a reimplementation of [[https://github.com/wh-xu/Hyper-Gen][HyperGen]] in Julia.

Miscellaneous:
- [[https://github.com/cvigilv/recetario][recetario]], a compendium of miscellaneous script for all things science, ML, DS, Julia, etc.
