First blog post! Excited to say the least. In this blog, I'll be focusing (mainly) on this
areas:

- _Neovim:_ Exploring the power and flexibility of this text editor
- _Julia Language:_ Discovering the capabilities of this high-performance programming language
- _Computational biology:_ Diving into the intersection of biology and computer science
