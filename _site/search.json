This gives my notes a cleaner structure.\n\nIn Neovim, you can simply select the code to sort and press :sort\n\nI also have backlogs with tasks I have jotted down to do at some moment.\n\nI generate this from time to time to compile all the tasks that are “open” (- [ ]), since this means this where not properly taken care of (either by doing this, defering, carrying over, or simply removing)\n\nHeavily customized Neovim config that makes using all of this easy.\n\nOutside the scope of this blog post, but investing time on developing tools that fit the needs you want is fun and crucial to make using them second nature."
