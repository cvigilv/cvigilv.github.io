<p>Before I start writing some posts on my journey on creating my
personalized research environment (my personal take on PDEs), I thought
it would be necessary to introduce the topic and what is my take on it
so I can later point in to the different aspects on it on the following
blog posts.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-personalized-development-environment">What is a
Personalized development Environment?</h2>
<p>Personalized Development Environment (PDEs for short, do not confuse
them with partial differential equations!) is a new take on development
environments based on the idea that assembling and personalize the
coding experience is a main component on the experience of, basically,
writing code.</p>
<p>This idea was first proposed by TJ DeVries, Neovim core maintainer,
on a long form video where he challenges the traditional text editor vs
IDE dichotomy. He argues that PDEs live in an "in between" space, since
they are neither a strip down text editor or a fully fledged IDE, as the
user may add or remove functionality depending on the experience they
seek.</p>
<p>In order to consider something a PDE, we have some requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must have some level of assembly, i.e. some level of
personalization, otherwise its not "personal"</li>
<li>Must have some basic coding functionality, i.e. syntax
highlight</li>
<li>Must have some kind of "code intelligence", i.e. LSP</li>
<li>Must allow the user to compose tools</li>
<li>Must be scriptable and extensible</li>
</ul>
<p>TJ says that apart from this requirements, the most important one is
that <strong>you are having fun using your coding environment</strong>
(I strongly agree with this and I'll go back to this later).</p>
<p>In summary, a PDE is a coding environment built for you by you in the
attempt of making coding fun. It's a pretty straightforward idea, but
its very broad depending on what you find fun and how much things you do
on your PDE.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-pde-to-me">What is a PDE to me</h2>
<p>To me, a PDE should be lots of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A research environment, since I'm a computational biologist</li>
<li>A note taking system, since, again, I'm a scientist, but I journal
quite heavily</li>
<li>A task manager and calendar</li>
<li>A Rolodex for contact management</li>
</ul>
<p>The most important aspect is that all of this has to be connected. I
sometimes have ideas on my personal life that fuel my research and vice
versa. I like having every aspect of my life in a single place as all of
this different aspect make <em>me</em>.</p>
<p>So, in broad terms, my PDE is more of a "Everything-goes
environment", but I like to think of myself as a scientist, where
everything I write (be it code, notes or journaling) fuel something
bigger: my understanding of the world and myself.</p>
<p>Colloquially, I call my PDE "The System", since it's something that's
bigger than just a development environment, but one can think of is of a
"Personal Research Environment": an environment that enables converting
knowledge into research question, which are then answered with code.</p>
<h2 id="the-system">"The System"</h2>
<p>So, "The System" is basically built with 3 main things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A code editor</li>
<li>A task manager</li>
<li>A note taking system</li>
</ul>
<p>I decided this are the minimum requirements for me to be able to
convert knowledge to research questions to code, as they tackle the main
aspects on the scientific method.</p>
<p>For those 3 main aspects, I have implemented everything in Neovim, a
modal code editor based on Vim with heavy focus on extensibility. I
decided to use Neovim for 3 main reasons: (i) I know it, (ii) I can
install it fairly easily, and (iii) is very easy to extend.</p>
<p>I'll write a series of posts going over how I tackle this in detail,
but as a summary I use the following technologies/plugins/techniques for
each of the previously mentioned aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>For code editor, I use <a href="https://neovim.io/">neovim</a> with
a combination of LSP, snippets and LLM to write code</li>
<li>A task manager, I use <a
href="https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode">orgmode.nvim</a> with
some heavy customization to implement a Getting Things Done workflow
I'll cover more in detail in a blog post</li>
<li>A note taking system, I use my <a
href="https://github.com/cvigilv/denote.nvim">denote.nvim</a> plugin to
consolidate notes, journals, documents, attachments, and more in a
single "silo" that composes "The System"</li>
</ul>
<p>This "PRE" has taken a lot of time to develop and is ever changing,
but in the last year that I have been using it for handling all of the
aspects of my life, while doing my PhD <strong>and</strong> moving to a
new country, I have never felt more in control and clear on where things
go and where things are, both in a practical and more philosophical
manner.</p>
<p>So on the following blog posts, I'll be sharing a little on how I do
things and how I combine different tools to achieve this PDE. I highly
recommend against copying it and using it yourself: this is highly
customized to how I do things and, even though I have tried hundreds of
different PDEs, I always fall back to my PDE since only I can really
solve the problems I have. I recommend you, the reader, do the same:
start small, start adding things, make it yours! It is the most
important part of this, since it is an eye opening process and it will
teach you a lot of the things you really use and find essential to
work.</p>
