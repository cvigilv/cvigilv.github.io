"Quality over quantity" only makes sense once you know, by experience, what makes something high
quality. The "quality" one gets through this process of getting to know what makes something of
"quality" must be reimbursed into this "quality" instance.

Make the "quantity" become "quality" by appreciating the knowledge it gave you.
